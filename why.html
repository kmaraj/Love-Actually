      <h2>Love Actually</h2>

      <p>
      My name is <a href="https://github.com/kmaraj">Karishma Maraj</a>. I am a Senior at NYU currently taking the CAMS course <a href="https://nyunews.com/2017/04/10/what-is-love-actually/">Love Actually</a>. For my Final Project I have decided to make this website. I have thorougly enjoyed every aspect of this course, but I was especially drawn to the unit on <b>Dating, Mating, and Partnering </b> where we explored modern dating. 

      <br>
      <br>

      The biggest takeaway from this Unit, for me at least, was that amidst all the different dating apps, ghosting, and overall lack of clarity in modern relationships, what truly takes two people from being strangers to more is a deliberate choice to be vulnerable. This is what Writer Mandy Lee Catron credits as the reason why her and her current partner are together. Catron writes in a NY Times <a href="https://nyunews.com/2017/04/10/what-is-love-actually/">article</a> about how she and a university acquaintance (who eventually became her partner) tried an experiment by Arthur Aron that led to them getting to know each other on a deeper level. The experiment is a list of 36 questions that start off light but go deeper and deeper and really allow two people to become vulnerable with each other. Their open attitude towards getting to know each other and the 36 questions led Catron into a relationship where a special level of intimacy was built from the moment they had their first date.

      <br>
      <br>

      For my project I wanted to make this experiment virtual. Due to the current circumstances, quarantine can cause everyone from single people to people in relationships not quarantined with their partner to experience a certain degree of loneliness. I also know that quarantine has either put a pause or a strain on people's dating lives and I wanted to test out Catron's dating philosophy. With these questions and with two people who are willing to put in the effort, can we overcome factors like not being in the same location? Is this active choice to get to know each other enough to build a level of intimacy? 

      <br>
      <br>
